# I or L Password Checker
As a Technology Support Technician, me and my team struggled to tell the difference between similar characters in the randomly-generated local admin passwords on various computers. To solve this problem, I developed a web-based tool utilizing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript to help differentiate characters such as i, I, l, L, 1, o, O, 0, etc.

To ease the readability of characters, the pasted password is displayed in a monospace font and colors each number a bright red. In addition, the website changes dynamically to accommodate mobile viewers as well as enhancing desktop users' experience.
